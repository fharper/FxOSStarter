FxOSStarter
===========

A starter project containing basic stuff to build new Firefox OS app (yes, I'm lazy). The idea is just to have a starting kit, so I don't have to create again, and again: the html, JavaScript, CSS, icons, and manifest file. For now, it's quite simple as the goal isn't to create a complete boilerplate like https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App (very useful is you start with Firefox OS development, or if you want to see how to implement specific features).

 Feel free to fork, and pull request, but the goal is really to keep it simple with the things you always use in a Firefox OS project.
